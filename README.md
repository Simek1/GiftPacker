Upon the first launch of the application, you will be prompted to perform the initial setup. The configuration involves adding content for messages that will appear after each puzzle, questions and answers for the quiz, and a final message hidden in the safe. Each of these messages conveys one of the three parts of the safe code. The content of the messages is intended to be a riddle, suggesting the sequence for entering each part of the code into the safe. Navigation between individual puzzles (detailed puzzle information can be found [here]()) is facilitated through tabs located at the top of the screen. The first tab pertains to the reward within the safe, where you should provide a message (ideally a message with good wishes) and an optional game key. The game key can then be copied by the gift recipient to activate the game on a chosen platform.
